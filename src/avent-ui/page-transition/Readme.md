# Page Transition : 

  Idea 1 :
    Add context to routes or App.jsx 
    Pass the Transition Prop  
    Wrap Pages with Transition that needs the page transition

    Components Need : 
      * Context for global state and configurations
      * Transition Wrapper 
      * Transition Props

  
  Better Improvements : 
    No need of Transition wrapper for componenets only context is enough - done 

  Improved : 
    Add Context and the transition props

  Components needed : 
    * Context with transition props and map the children with wrapper
    * Transition Props
